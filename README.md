### Business Goals

- The main goal of this website is to convert visitors into customers, it's primary focus is to show users that the content and information
of this website has been created by people who are experienced in travel specifically in New Zealand. 

- The content provided by this business is to ensure that every step of travel is covered from flights and accommodation, to attractions and 
where to eat. It will also provide recommendations on which locations they may want to visit and why, and further information on what to do when 
visiting these destinations. The purpose of this is so that users can book and organise their whole trip in one location, therefore, removing the need 
to book each aspect through different websites, creating a highly in demand platform.

- Once a user has explored the website finding all the information required they will then have to contact the business with either a general 
enquiry or with details on their required booking. This will be easily found through a simple contact page that outlines the best practices for using 
the form, allowing for initial contact with the business to be a quick process and for rapport and trust to be quickly built.

### User Centered Design

#### Strategy

- With the main goal for this website to convert visitors into customers the use of aesthetically pleasing and dramatic imagery will be used to
draw the user in, followed by informative and useful information providing facts that interest the user and are relevant to their travel desires.

- The chance of the user converting to a customer heightens dramatically once they make contact with the business through the booking form. In order for
this to happen the website needs to be engaging with excellent user experience to keep the visitor from navigating away from the page before completing the 
contact form.

- This website is aimed at users who want to spend anywhere from three weeks to a few months travelling, with the idea of the trip being a once in a lifetime 
experience. The prices and overall cost of such things as flights, accommodation and attractions will be high which will reduce the relatable audience to that of
visitors who are not worried about price. Due to this the website will have a high end luxury feel to match.

---

#### Scope | Trade Off 

- **The main features and content in the initial design plan that are of highest priority are;**
    - Fully responsive website regardless of viewing device size.
    - Fixed navigation bar.
    - A recommendations section that includes top destinations and attractions.
    - The use of various API's to display real-time information to the user.
    - Interactive clickable features that allow the user to find relevant or further information.
    - Two different 'Explore' pages for both the North and South Island's.
    - A contact page that includes an easy to use form that sends emails to an account using [Emailjs.](https://www.emailjs.com/)
    - Internal page links that direct the user to further information if required.

- **The features and content in the initial design plan that are of a lower priority and may not be including in this build are;**
    - The use of various booking platforms and widgets integrated into the website.
    - Information regarding car and campervan hire.
    - Creating fixed price package trips that include multiple locations and attractions.
    - An 'About' page or section that includes information about the business.
    - A newsletter or blog subscription form.
    - Gallery page or section.

---

- Navigation - *Top level*
    - The fixed navigation bar will allow users to navigate to all other pages regardless of the section they are currently viewing.

- Body - *Main page elements*
    - The main hero image's will be dramatic New Zealand landscapes that draw the users attention and aids in selling the websites product.

    - Buttons will be placed at important sections that allow the user to click the link and find out more. This is so that first 
    time users are not overloaded with information straight away.

- Footer - *Bottom level*
    - Mirroring the navigation bar to ensure the user can navigate the page easily.

    - Social media links placed here to ensure the user does not navigate away from the page to soon.

## Design
 
### Colour Scheme

- The colour scheme for this website is based on a well known colour scheme of black and gold. I have altered this to better suit the aesthetics of the project using a raw umber shade in 
place of gold and a very light pink to balance these two striking and bold colours. These colours will also tie in with the imagery used especially the hero images for each page that will 
consist of dramatic and contrasting dark blues and greens as well as warm oranges. These natural colours help convey feelings of rest and relaxation which is key for travel, as well as 
portraying the colours associated with the New Zealand landscape. 

-  Black Tone (#0C0409) - This colour which has some small tonal changes from a normal black colour will only be used for the navigation bar and the footer. The reason for this is 
to represent New Zealands well known and recognisable *All Blacks* colour.

- Pig Pink (#F5EBE0) - Primary Colour - Used throughout the website as the background colour for all pages, a light grey pink colour that compliments the black used in the navigation and footer well.

- Raw Umber (#A58961) - Secondary Colour - Also described as a bronze/gold shade and a typical colour pairing with black, Raw Umber will also feature heavily throughout the website used for
borders and alternative background colours when using boxes/cards for content. This colour also works very well with the main hero imagery used on each page such as sand, beaches and sunsets.

---

### Typography 

- There will be two fonts used throughout this website. The font used for the logo and headings is Bodoni Moda, for the remaining website content 
the Montserrat font will be used. Since both of these fonts are of the serif typeface Sans Serif will be used as the fallback font in case there 
is an issue when importing the fonts, or browsers not supporting these.

- **Bodoni Moda** - The reason this font is being used for the logo and headings is due to it's striking appearance and extreme contrast between
the thick and thin lines in the text. This will immediately catch the users attention and direct them to the most important parts of the page.

- **Montserrat** - This font is an ideal pairing with Bodoni Moda and works perfectly for content due to its clean, simple lines that don't draw 
attention away from the other important aspects on the page. Due to it's popularity this is a font that many users will be familiar with evoking a feeling 
of comfort and trust as well as being aesthetically pleasing.

---

### Logo

- A very simplistic and minimal logo was used for this project consisting of the company name in the **Bodoni Moda** font that is consistently used throughout the website. Alongside this 
the globally recognised white New Zealand fern designed by [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/term/silver-fern/379641/) was used to immediately convey to the user what and where
this websites focus is.

---

### Imagery 

- The type of imagery used within this website will be of great importance as this is what will be used to initially convince first time users 
that planning a trip to New Zealand is the right decision. This will be done by using dramatic and eye catching landscape imagery that really displays
the beauty of the country. Firstly, this will be achieved by a full screen hero image displayed at the top of each page that not only conveys what the website is 
about but will also make the user want to see more.

- Images will also be used to convey information and work alongside text content, this will be especially important when displaying what attractions, destinations
and restaurants are available or recommended. The images used to inform the user of different attractions available will be more of a documentary style telling a story of what the user 
could experience should they visit these places.

- For informing and showing the user the possible destinations available to visit the imagery will be mainly dramatic and intriguing landscape shots showing the beauty of a particular area.
This will automatically make the user want to see more of this destination and increase the likelihood of them wanting to visit whilst on their trip.  

- There will also be the use of font icons throughout the website imported from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/) These will be used in a way to further 
enhance certain sections on the website such as flights, accommodation, travelling and planning. By using these icons in a way that isn't excessive it will add 
a professional and clean aesthetic feel to the website.

#### Specific Landing Page Features

- Two responsive carousels used to display popular destinations and popular attractions. These are fully responsive and work extremely well on touch screen devices due to the ability of
swiping left and right to change the image displayed instead of always using the chevron button. The initial code for the carousels was taken from [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) 
and customised for this project.

#### Specific North & South Island Page Features

such as restaurants, accommodation and tourist attractions.

- [Bootstraps](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/card/) card layout code is used to display the 'Top Pick' information for each destination, this code was then customised to better
suit the aesthetics of this project.

- A simple table that is used to display the flight information when the user selects the destination they are interested in.

- Internal page anchor links and buttons are heavily used throughout the destinations section in order to better improve the UX so that when the user clicks on a button the page moves to the relevant 
information in order to reduce the users scroll time.

#### Specific Contact Page Features

- A detailed contact from that allows the user to inform the website of the trip they would like to book including travel dates and interested destinations.

- A fully connected and validated contact form using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/). This not only sends the users enquiry to the website but also sends an automatic response to the user
informing them that their request has been received as well as including their original request in the response email for them to check over.

---

### Future Features 

- Include possible booking widgets/travel relevant API's so that users can book directly through the website without needing to navigate away or complete the contact form.

- Add a blog page that includes posts about real travel stories to New Zealand.

- Create a gallery page that mirrors an real life Instagram feed showing images posted of the websites users on their trip.

- Include a search bar that allows the user to find all content relevant to either a location or an attraction.

- Create a separate contact modal form for general enquires and then adapt the current contact page to be a further details booking form e.g allow the user to select specific attractions or 
activities they would like to do on their trip, as well as include flight options in the form.

- Customise the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) aesthetics further to create a more unique map for this site e.g. alter marker pin images 
and add further business content to info windows.

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
    - Used whilst trying to overcome any problems and achieve certain outcomes that at that time I did not have the knowledge on how to do, as well as offer certain CSS design inspiration.

---

### Code

Listed below is any code that was taken from external resources and customised for this project, this is also referenced in the specific webpage files.

- [CSS box Shadow Effects](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples)
    - A library of varying ready to use box shadow effects available from getcssscan.com these were widely used throughout this project for image shadows, button shadows and container
    shadows.

- [Carousel Text Hover Effect](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_opacity)
    - When wanting to apply a simple hover effect over the carousel images I found an example on w3 Schools that I then customised the styles to better suit the aesthetics of this project.

- [Change navbar Background Colour on Scroll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23706003/changing-nav-bar-color-after-scrolling)
    - In order to not negatively impact the aesthetics of the hero image did not want the fixed navbar to have a background colour, however, when the user began scrolling the readability was
    badly affected. To fix this I wanted the background colour to change when the user reached a certain scroll point of the page, I found an example of this on Stack Overflow that I used for 
    this project.

- [Skyscanner API JSON Fetch Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxf0--uiX0I&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain)
    - When trying to implement the Skyscanner API used for flights I struggled to understand how to correctly use JSON to fetch the data I wanted. This YouTube video helped my understanding 
    of how to use this greatly.

- [Skyscanner API Init Function](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search)
    - The initial `fetch` code used to implement the Skyscanner API was taken from the example code displayed on Rapid API's website.

- [Hover Effects](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - For all link and button hover effects I used examples from the vast library of Hover.css which provides many code snippets to quickly add effects to certain elements.

- [Navbar, Flights Table & Contact Form](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - These three features all used example code from Bootstrap and were all heavily customised for this project but still utilised Bootstraps responsivity.

- [Emailjs & Google Maps](https://codeinstitute.net/)
    - The initial code to implement these features was taken from Code Institute's learning material available to it's students. It was then altered and added to in order to suit this project.

- [Display Local Google Places Business](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58206884/how-do-i-get-google-maps-to-display-nearby-restaurants)
    - When wanting to utilise Google Places to display relevant businesses within a certain radius I found some example code on Stack Overflow which I used to achieve this.

- [Google Places Info Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2223574/google-maps-auto-close-open-infowindows)
    - Following on from fetching the Google Places data I also wanted to display the business name when the user clicked on the relevant marker, however, I wanted any open info windows to 
    close when doing so to ensure there was only one window open at a time. I found example code for this on Stack Overflow which I then used.

- [Display one desired element/elements at a time](https://dev.to/mohdhussein/how-to-show-the-clicked-element-only-and-hide-others-in-vanilla-javascript-1ip2)
    - There are multiple functions within this project that need the user to select a specific button to display the content, for all of these I only wanted one of the desired elements 
    to be visible at a time. This meant needing to create a loop with an `if statement` which I was unsure on how to achieve. I found a perfect example on dev.to that used matching 
    `data-number` attributes on the relevant elements and containers that would only display if the button selected matched the hidden elements. 

- [Only allow users to select the current day or future dates on the contact form](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/html/how+to+disable+previous+date+in+html+input+type+date)
    - My mentor pointed out a bug that allowed users to select past dates for there travel which is of course not possible. I found some example code on how to achieve this and implemented
    the function on page load that retrieved the current date and assigned the `min` HTML attribute to the date input.

- [Code Institute Code](https://codeinstitute.net/)
    - For the basic  function to initialise the map, set the location and place markers I used the code the [Code Institutes](https://codeinstitute.net/) learning material on 
    API's, it was then adapted for this project.
    - For the initial use of [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) I used the code provided in [Code Institutes](https://codeinstitute.net/) learning material on using this library, it was
    then adapted to send emails in a desired way for this project.
