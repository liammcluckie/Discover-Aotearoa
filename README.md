## Business Goals

- The main goal of this website is to convert visitors into customers, it's primary focus is to show users that the content and information
of this website has been created by people who are experienced in travel specifically in New Zealand. 

- The content provided by this business is to ensure that every step of travel is covered from flights and accommodation, to attractions and 
where to eat. It will also provide recommendations on which locations they may want to visit and why, and further information on what to do when 
visiting these destinations. The purpose of this is so that users can book and organise their whole trip in one location, therefore, removing the need 
to book each aspect through different websites, creating a highly in demand platform.

- Once a user has explored the website finding all the information required they will then have to contact the business with either a general 
enquiry or with details on their required booking. This will be easily found through a simple contact page that outlines the best practices for using 
the form, allowing for initial contact with the business to be a quick process and for rapport and trust to be quickly built.

### User Centered Design

#### Strategy

- With the main goal for this website to convert visitors into customers the use of aesthetically pleasing and dramatic imagery will be used to
draw the user in, followed by informative and useful information providing facts that interest the user and are relevant to their travel desires.

- The chance of the user converting to a customer heightens dramatically once they make contact with the business through the booking form. In order for
this to happen the website needs to be engaging with excellent user experience to keep the visitor from navigating away from the page before completing the 
contact form.

- This website is aimed at users who want to spend anywhere from three weeks to a few months travelling, with the idea of the trip being a once in a lifetime 
experience. The prices and overall cost of such things as flights, accommodation and attractions will be high which will reduce the relatable audience to that of
visitors who are not worried about price. Due to this the website will have a high end luxury feel to match.
